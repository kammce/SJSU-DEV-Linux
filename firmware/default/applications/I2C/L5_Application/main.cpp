     * A few basic tasks for this bare-bone system :
     *      1.  Terminal task provides gateway to interact with the board through UART terminal.
     *      2.  Remote task allows you to use remote control to interact with the board.
     *      3.  Wireless task responsible to receive, retry, and handle mesh network.
     *
     * Disable remote task if you are not using it.  Also, it needs SYS_CFG_ENABLE_TLM
     * such that it can save remote control codes to non-volatile memory.  IR remote
     * control codes can be learned by typing the "learn" terminal command.
